Listed in chronological order.


* Simple Mathematical Word Problems Solving with Deep Learning [[report](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/reports/custom/15843468.pdf)]
  * CS 224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning, Stanford University
  * Preprocessed the complicated AQUA-RAT dataset and extracted all mathematical equations using regular expressions from the given explanation of multiple choices questions
  * Implemented Transformer Network and Bidirectional GRU-LSTM RNN with attention units to conduct seq2seq task, which generates a set of mathematical equations that can solve the given algebraic word mathematical problems with a moderate level of performance


* AI Agent for the Atari Game Phoenix [[poster](http://szcheng0702.github.io/files/CS_221_Poster.pdf)]
  * CS 221: Artificial intelligence principles and techniques, Stanford University                                     
  * Built an AI agent to play the game ‘Phoenix’ using Deep Q-learning Network (DQN)
  * Coordinated with teammates and implemented the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Algorithm as a faster alternative 


* Video Interpolation of Human Motion [[report](https://cs230.stanford.edu/projects_spring_2018/reports/8290324.pdf)]
  * CS 230: Deep Learning, Stanford University
  * Constructed the baseline Encoder-Decoder Model to interpolate the intermediate frames when the start and end frames of a video are given
  * Designed a 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and recurrent CNN (rCNN) and tuned hyperparameters to improve the quality of the frames interpolated


* Sensor Network Localization 
  * CME 307: Optimization, Stanford University                                                                       
  * Tackled the Sensor Network Localization (SNL) problem using Second Order Cone, Semidefinite Dual and Least Square methods
  * Adopted Alternating Direction Method with Multipliers (ADMM) with certain permutations to speed up the process in solving 3D SNL problems with 10 sensors

    
* Fake News Stance Detection [[report](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2017/final-reports/5244160.pdf)]
  * CS 229: Machine Learning, Stanford University                                                                    
  * Extracted features including N-gram, word sentiments, polarity and cosine similarities from 75385 newspaper articles 
  * Performed multinomial Bayes, SVM, softmax and multi-layer Neural Network on the above features from training set and dev set
  * Chose the best algorithm to predict whether the newspaper’s headline agrees/disagrees/discusses/is unrelated to its body

                                                              
* Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for Digit Clustering
  * Math 156: Machine Learning, UCLA
  * Conducted Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on MNIST dataset to reduce the data’s dimensionality 
  * Implemented the Expectation Maximization algorithm of GMM using MATLAB, and fed it with 14000 sets of training data
  * Tested the algorithm using the testing data, and compared the results to that of the MATLAB-implemented k-means algorithm
